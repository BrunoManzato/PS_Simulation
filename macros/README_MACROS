	MACRO FILES TO RUN THE PLASTIC SCINTILLATOR SIMULATION

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

***In this directory, you'll finde some pre-made Macro files to run our simulation.

***All of then are .mac files, the default archive for GEANT4

***Macro files like that allows us to make changes in the source of particles and some visualizations 
without recompile the program (what saves a lot of time!)

	1)VIS.MAC
    This macro file generates the geometry of the detector without any particle in it.
    It's very good to check that the geometry is right.
    
    	2)VISMUONS.MAC
    This macro creates the geometry and a single muon of 5 GeV, what is faster for visualization.
    You can use it to check the scintillation effect. I suggest to change the Scintillation Yeld
    to a small number in the detector construction file (MyDetector.cpp in principle), because a 
    high number can override the visualizer.
    
    	3)RUNMUONS.MAC
    This macro creates several muons (50, in principle) and do not show the geometry, what allows to
    run the simulation with correct parameters (like Scintillation Yeld>10000 photons/MeV) in 
    smaller computers. I runned 50 muons in a 4GB RAM computer, and it works very well, the
    simulation takes about 3 to 5 minutes in this set.
    
    	4)PHOTONS.MAC
    This macro generates one single optical photon of 2.5 eV and polarization vector (1,1,1) 
    (in principle, also you can always change those parameters in the macro file). It's very good 
    to visualize with the optical fiber simulation (OpticalFiber.cpp simulation file).
